I used Redux for data managment,
redux-persist for caching data to AsyncStorage,
All data is dummy data, there is not any api or something,
Indicator no need to implement becaouse there is not any loading part,
React Navigation for navigating screens,
I used Circular Bar SVG for progress bar,
Not enough time to create dark mode
